# Rutt Etra (Live Video)
![screenshot](https://s12.postimg.org/4elpba5j1/image.png)

Update from the introwerks Rutt Etra Emulator for Processing. Now you can use it with your PC camera or external cameras. Also, you can send video via Spout. It's also sound reactive.

For using the sketch with a DSLR or another external camera, you can use [SparkoCam](http://sparkosoft.com/sparkocam) as a virtual camera.

To export the sketch as a video, install the [Video Export](http://funprogramming.org/VideoExport-for-Processing/) librarie and [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/). Then you can run the [sketch](https://github.com/pierreee1/Rutt-Etra-Live-Video/blob/master/ruttetravideoandsound_VideoExport.pde) (I'm testing thins function, if you get an error, so please notify any error!)
